Gnome Screenshot provides a graphical interface. You use a graphical interface to take screenshots very easily.\n\nOther hands scort is a command-line tool, and scort does not provide any graphical interface.So I'm personally again recommended you use Gnome Screenshot.\n\n### Install Gnome Screenshot in Raspbian or Raspberry pi 4:\n\n**let start it:**\n\nThe Raspi 4 does not provide by default Gnome Screenshot.\n\nFirstly Update your raspberry pi 4. this is a compulsory step for installing Gnome Screenshot.\n\n```cmd\nsudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade\n```\n\nYour update and upgrade command run successfully. Now you install Gnome Screenshot following command.\n\n```cmd\nsudo apt install gnome-screenshot\n```\n\nNow you can find Gnome Screenshot in your accessories menu, listed as \"Screenshot.\"\n\n![sceenshot](https://ephemeral-rolypoly-2f9988.netlify.app/images/geenome.png)\n\n\nGnome interface is very easy to understand.
